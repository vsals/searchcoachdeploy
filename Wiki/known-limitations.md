## Message throttling

Unless your bot is whitelisted for higher limits, the bot's attempt at sending a message will get throttled at 8,000 messages every 30 minutes (rolling window). If you exceed this limit, you will see messages in the throttled state. 

## No retries

If your message is throttled, there is no retry. There is also no way for the creator to explicitly retry sending a failed message.

We intend to add the ability to retry failed messages in the next version of the template.

## App installation is required

The app can only send messages to users and teams who have the app installed. To mitigate this limitation and reach a wider audience, install the app in personal scope for all the intended recipients in the tenant, as well as in the teams to allow a targeted message to be delivered. This is to be done outside the app manually. 

## Author/publishing experience not supported on Mobile

The tab where authors/creators of messages create a message is currently not supported on mobile. The recommended approach is to create the messages on desktop only.
